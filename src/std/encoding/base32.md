# Base32 Encoding

The `:std/encoding/base32` module implements the standard RFC 4648 Base32
alphabet (`A-Z2-7`), not Base32hex or Crockford Base32.

## base32-encode

```text
(base32-encode (bytes : :u8vector)
               padding: (padding? : :boolean := #t)
               lowercase: (lowercase? : :boolean := #f))
  => :string
```

Returns a new string encoding all input bytes, preserving leading zero bytes.
The default is uppercase with `=` padding to a multiple of eight characters.
`padding: #f` omits padding; `lowercase: #t` uses `a-z2-7`. No line breaks or
prefixes are inserted. Empty input returns an empty string.

For `n` input bytes the output length is `8 * ceiling(n / 5)` with padding,
or `ceiling(8 * n / 5)` without it. An output length outside the fixnum range
raises `ContractViolation`; allocation failures propagate from the runtime.

## base32-decode

```text
(base32-decode (str : :string)
               no-padding: (no-padding? : :boolean := #f))
  => :u8vector
```

Returns a new byte vector. Uppercase, lowercase and mixed-case letters are
accepted. By default, complete padding is required for partial eight-character
groups. Complete groups need no padding. `no-padding: #t` additionally permits
correct unpadded input; it still accepts correctly padded input and does not
relax any other validation. Empty input is valid in either mode.

The decoder rejects:

- Characters outside `A-Z`, `a-z`, `2-7`, and terminal padding, including
  whitespace, non-ASCII characters, `0`, `1`, `8`, and `9`.
- Data lengths congruent to 1, 3, or 6 modulo 8.
- Interior, missing (unless permitted), excessive, or incorrect padding.
  Data-length residues 2, 4, 5, and 7 require respectively 6, 4, 3, and 1
  padding characters when padding is present. Complete groups take none.
- Nonzero unused low bits in the last data character, even without padding.

Malformed encodings raise `ContractViolation` with `base32-decode` as the
error location and diagnostic irritants: input `length`, plus `data-length`
for impossible lengths, `index` and `padding` for padding errors, or `index`
and `char` for invalid characters and pad bits. Indexes are zero-based;
padding errors report the start of trailing padding (or the input length
when required padding is missing). If several rules are violated, length
and padding validation can report an error before character validation.
Argument types and boolean options are checked by the declared contracts.

## DNS-Safe Labels

```scheme
(import :std/encoding/base32)

(base32-encode #u8(102 111 111) padding: #f lowercase: #t)
;; => "mzxw6"
(base32-decode "mzxw6" no-padding: #t)
;; => #u8(102 111 111)
```

Lowercase unpadded output uses only DNS-safe letters and digits. The codec
does not enforce DNS label or hostname limits, add DID prefixes, or split
labels. A single DNS label must be nonempty and at most 63 octets; without
additional prefixes, at most 39 input bytes fit in one Base32 label.

Both operations run in linear time with a bounded accumulator of at most
12 bits and constant auxiliary space besides the result. Decoding validates
without re-encoding and allocates exactly `floor(5 * d / 8)` bytes for `d`
data characters. Inputs are not modified. There is no application-specific
size limit beyond runtime string/vector capacity, the encoding fixnum-size
check, and available memory.
