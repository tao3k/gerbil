;;;; CSV support, ported from Common Lisp's fare-csv
;;; © fare at tunes.org
;;
;; CSV is intrinsically an underspecified lossy format,
;; and even popular PC applications lose heavily
;; (i.e. no quoting convention at all, not even a pascal-like one)
;; when text fields contain the quote character. Ouch.
;;
;; This spec seems to explain popular usage, is refered by docs below.
;; http://www.creativyst.com/Doc/Articles/CSV/CSV01.htm
;;
;; This one says about the same:
;; http://edoceo.com/utilitas/csv-file-format
;;
;; There's now an RFC that tries to standardize CSV:
;; http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4180.txt
;;
;; Here's what Perl hackers think CSV is:
;; http://search.cpan.org/~hmbrand/Text-CSV_XS-0.59/CSV_XS.pm
;;
;;        (read-csv source)            ; all lines from any source
;;        (read-csv-line source)       ; one line from any source
;;        (write-csv writer lines)     ; all lines to any sink
;;        (write-csv-line writer fields) ; one line to any sink
;;
;; source/sink accepts anything with-buffered-reader/writer accepts:
;;   BufferedReader/Writer, port, u8vector, string (as content), #f (memory), etc.
